# CheapCoin: A Tiny Blockchain & Cryptocurrency in Python  

## What is CheapCoin?  
CheapCoin is a minimalistic blockchain implementation written in Python that demonstrates the fundamentals of how cryptocurrencies work. It includes:  

- A basic blockchain structure  
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining  
- Transaction handling  
- A simple Flask API to interact with the blockchain

## How CheapCoin Works  

### 1. The Blockchain Structure  
A blockchain is a linked list of blocks, where each block contains:  

- Index – Position in the chain  
- Timestamp – When the block was created  
- Data – Stores transactions  
- Previous Hash – Reference to the last block (ensuring immutability)  
- Block Hash – Unique identifier (generated using SHA-256)  

Each block’s hash is calculated using SHA-256:  

```python
def calculate_hash(self):
    block_string = f"{self.index}{self.timestamp}{self.data}{self.previous_hash}".encode()
    return hashlib.sha256(block_string).hexdigest()
```
Why is SHA-256 important?  
- Ensures security (impossible to reverse-engineer)  
- Guarantees integrity (modifying a past block invalidates all future blocks)  
- Provides consistency (fixed-length output)  

---

### 2. The Genesis Block  
Every blockchain starts with a Genesis Block (the first block in the chain).  
Since there is no previous block, its previous hash is set to "0".  

Genesis Block Creation:  
```python
def create_genesis_block():
    return Block(0, time.time(), "Genesis Block", "0")
```

---

### 3. Proof-of-Work and Mining  
Without a control mechanism, blocks could be created instantly, making the blockchain vulnerable to spam and attacks.  

Proof-of-Work (PoW) introduces a computational challenge that:  
- Slows down block creation  
- Prevents abuse  
- Ensures security  

CheapCoin’s PoW Algorithm:  
- A miner must find a number (proof) such that:  
  ```bash
  (proof + previous_proof) % 9 == 0
  ```
- Miners brute-force different numbers until they find a valid one.  
- The difficulty is adjustable by changing the rule.  

CheapCoin’s PoW Function:  
```python
def proof_of_work(last_proof):
    proof = 0
    while not (proof + last_proof) % 9 == 0:
        proof += 1
    return proof
```
Mining is computationally expensive, securing the blockchain.  

---

### 4. The Mining Process  
Miners solve the PoW challenge, creating a new block that is added to the chain. Mining also rewards miners by including a special transaction in the new block.  

Mining API in CheapCoin:  
```python
@app.route('/mine', methods=['GET'])
def mine_block():
    new_block = create_new_block(blockchain[-1])
    blockchain.append(new_block)
    transactions.clear()
    return jsonify({
        "message": "New block mined",
        "block": {
            "index": new_block.index,
            "timestamp": new_block.timestamp,
            "data": new_block.data,
            "previous_hash": new_block.previous_hash,
            "hash": new_block.hash
        }
    })
```
Mining regulates new coin creation and ensures decentralization.  

---

### 5. Transactions  
Users can send and receive CheapCoin via transactions.  
Each transaction contains:  
- Sender Address  
- Receiver Address  
- Amount of CheapCoin  

Transaction Handling API:  
```python
transactions = []

@app.route('/transaction', methods=['POST'])
def add_transaction():
    tx_data = request.get_json()
    transactions.append(tx_data)
    return jsonify({"message": "Transaction added", "transaction": tx_data}), 201
```

Create a transaction via cURL:  
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/transaction      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{"from": "Alice", "to": "Bob", "amount": 10}'
```

Transactions remain in memory until a new block is mined.

### 6. Viewing the Blockchain  
CheapCoin provides an API to retrieve the entire blockchain.  

Blockchain API:  
```python
@app.route('/blockchain', methods=['GET'])
def get_blockchain():
    chain_data = [{
        "index": block.index,
        "timestamp": block.timestamp,
        "data": block.data,
        "previous_hash": block.previous_hash,
        "hash": block.hash
    } for block in blockchain]
    return jsonify(chain_data)
```

Check the blockchain via cURL:  
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/blockchain
```

## Next Steps for CheapCoin  
- Add Wallets and Digital Signatures  
- Deploy the Network on Multiple Machines  
- Implement a Real Consensus Algorithm (Replacing longest-chain rule)  
- Build a Frontend UI

## Running CheapCoin Locally  

1. Create a Virtual Environment  
```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Dependencies  
```bash
uv pip install flask
```

3. Start the Blockchain API  
```bash
python3 cheapcoin.py
```

4. Create a Transaction  
```bash

```

5. Mine a Block  
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine
```
