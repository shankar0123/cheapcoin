🪙 cheapcoin: A Tiny Blockchain & Cryptocurrency in Python

📌 What is cheapcoin?

cheapcoin is a minimalistic blockchain implementation written in Python that demonstrates the fundamentals of how cryptocurrencies work. It includes:

✅ A basic blockchain structure
✅ Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining ⛏️
✅ Transaction handling 💳
✅ A simple Flask API to interact with the blockchain 🌍

⚙️ How cheapcoin Works

🔗 1. The Blockchain Structure

A blockchain is a linked list of blocks, where each block contains:
	•	🆔 Index → Position in the chain
	•	⏳ Timestamp → When the block was created
	•	📄 Data → Stores transactions
	•	🔗 Previous Hash → Reference to the last block (ensuring immutability)
	•	🔒 Block Hash → Unique identifier (generated using SHA-256)

Each block’s hash is calculated using SHA-256:

def calculate_hash(self):
    block_string = f"{self.index}{self.timestamp}{self.data}{self.previous_hash}".encode()
    return hashlib.sha256(block_string).hexdigest()

🔹 Why is SHA-256 important?
✅ Ensures security (impossible to reverse-engineer)
✅ Guarantees integrity (modifying a past block invalidates all future blocks)
✅ Provides consistency (fixed-length output)

⸻

🌱 2. The Genesis Block

Every blockchain starts with a Genesis Block (the first block in the chain).
Since there is no previous block, its previous hash is set to "0".

📌 Genesis Block Creation:

def create_genesis_block():
    return Block(0, time.time(), "Genesis Block", "0")



⸻

⛏️ 3. Proof-of-Work and Mining

Without a control mechanism, blocks could be created instantly, making the blockchain vulnerable to spam & attacks.

Proof-of-Work (PoW) introduces a computational challenge that:
	•	Slows down block creation 🔄
	•	Prevents abuse 🛑
	•	Ensures security 🔐

🔹 cheapcoin’s PoW Algorithm:
	•	A miner must find a number (proof) such that:

(proof + previous_proof) % 9 == 0


	•	Miners brute-force different numbers until they find a valid one.
	•	The difficulty is adjustable by changing the rule.

📌 cheapcoin’s PoW Function:

def proof_of_work(last_proof):
    proof = 0
    while not (proof + last_proof) % 9 == 0:
        proof += 1
    return proof

⏳ Mining is computationally expensive, securing the blockchain!

⸻

🏗️ 4. The Mining Process

Miners solve the PoW challenge, creating a new block that is added to the chain. Mining also rewards miners by including a special transaction in the new block.

📌 Mining API in cheapcoin:

@app.route('/mine', methods=['GET'])
def mine_block():
    new_block = create_new_block(blockchain[-1])
    blockchain.append(new_block)
    transactions.clear()
    return jsonify({
        "message": "New block mined",
        "block": {
            "index": new_block.index,
            "timestamp": new_block.timestamp,
            "data": new_block.data,
            "previous_hash": new_block.previous_hash,
            "hash": new_block.hash
        }
    })

✅ Mining regulates new coin creation & ensures decentralization

⸻

💳 5. Transactions

Users can send & receive cheapcoin via transactions.
Each transaction contains:
	•	📤 Sender Address
	•	📥 Receiver Address
	•	💰 Amount of cheapcoin

📌 Transaction Handling API:

transactions = []

@app.route('/transaction', methods=['POST'])
def add_transaction():
    tx_data = request.get_json()
    transactions.append(tx_data)
    return jsonify({"message": "Transaction added", "transaction": tx_data}), 201

📌 Create a transaction via cURL:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/transaction \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"from": "Alice", "to": "Bob", "amount": 10}'

🔹 Transactions remain in memory until a new block is mined.

🌍 6. Viewing the Blockchain

cheapcoin provides an API to retrieve the entire blockchain.

📌 Blockchain API:

@app.route('/blockchain', methods=['GET'])
def get_blockchain():
    chain_data = [{
        "index": block.index,
        "timestamp": block.timestamp,
        "data": block.data,
        "previous_hash": block.previous_hash,
        "hash": block.hash
    } for block in blockchain]
    return jsonify(chain_data)

📌 Check the blockchain via cURL:

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/blockchain
